But I gave myself plenty of time to get there, so I didn’t come late to my first lecture.</p><p>My first lecture was INFT1004, within the Great hall at Callaghan. I attempted to make friends at first, and me a person who was friendly, the lecture wasn’t anything special, it was just an introduction like most first year lecture, and the person I met fell asleep next to me, so that was a bit funny. The lecturer recommended to download lost on campus app. Which I did ASAP. I only have one lecture on my first day.</p><p><strong>Semester Bulk</strong></p><p>After that, I came back for the rest of the week and basically just kept to myself, I attended each lecture and workshop following on that, to keep up to date with all of the content that was being offered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The first semester that I had was nothing special, I followed on with each piece of content and assessment somewhat easily, as going to each class really helped out with the hardest parts of the assessments that I was being given.</p><p>I didn’t go to one workshop and I was lost on what to do, the lectures did always say if you have any problems around the assessments, you should email them, which I did, and they put me on track.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Always kept ample room to get assessments complete on time, and if I had any problems I would either bring my laptop into workshops to get help, or I would email. Some assessments were very stressful and I felt very clueless on how to do a couple things, and what path I should take with an assessment, but going to the teachers for all of this information was the correct thing to do.</p><p><strong>Exams</strong></p><p>Studying for exams was probably the most stressful thing I’ve ever done, you will tend to second guess yourself on if you know every part of information, but you have to remember that you are human, and you can’t remember everything, luckily as an IT student reference sheets were used.</p><p>The exam days were the most anxious thing I had done back then, as reference sheets were in nearly all of my courses, even through lectures said ‘you can’t put the whole semester on your paper’. Even through I nearly did put the whole semester on it. It really helped as nearly every question that I was stuck on, I would have to dive into my reference sheet to find the answer. It was not very time efficient what so ever, but it worked. I do not advise this at all!!</p>', 'tate', '2021-05-29 02:54:07', '2021-05-29 02:54:07'),
(3, 'My first semester - Quenton', '<p><strong>My first day</strong></p><p>Like most first year students, I was nervous when I first went to university. In case I could not find my way on the first day of class, I spent a day in advance acquainting myself with the campus. When I walked around campus, I used an app called ‘Lost on Campus’ which was recommended by my roommate. This app shows a route between the user and the destination in the campus. I thought this app was not that useful, the map was not detailed enough and there were sometimes delays. I found there were general maps printed in many parts of the campus, so I used my phone to take a photo of it. That became my main method to find my route in my future time.</p><p><strong>My first class</strong></p><p>My first class is a lecture. Thanks to my familiarity with the campus in advance, I get to the classroom easily. It was a great Amphitheatre. All students who enrolled in the same course that semester listened to the teacher explain the course content. A course usually consists of two parts, one is lecture and the other is workshop. Workshop is sometimes called lab; it is like students who enroll in the course are divided into several groups and do some tasks. One or two tutors help students solve the problems they encounter. My first week there were no workshops.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Most of the semester time</strong></p><p>After lectures and workshops, I usually go to the library. The library is a good place for study, it has a good stock of books which may help with the study. Besides, it is a place with a good learning atmosphere. I usually meet some other students who are doing the same courses. We solved some issues by studying together. Also, it is a nice opportunity to make friends there.</p><p><strong>Assessment</strong></p><p>In general, each course has its assessment which may contain essays, assignments, projects and exams. Usually there is a deadline for the assessment. Once I put off an assignment until the deadline, I had to stay up all night to finish it. So, it is not wise to leave the work until the last minute. Later I learned to draw a circle of the date on my calendar if it is an assignment deadline or exam day.</p>', 'quenton', '2021-05-29 02:58:40', '2021-05-29 02:58:40'),
(4, 'My First Semester - Dipesh Pulami', '<p>I am an international student and I was very excited to get started when I got accepted into the university. After I got accepted, I arrived in Australia around 15 days before the semester began. I came to the university after a few days to know how to get started and what I need to do, as I was told to report to university after my arrival. Student Central was the place where I got to know about things I need to know. This is where I learned important things like:</p><ul><li>How to use my UON, myHub and Blackboard</li><li>I learned how to enroll in courses and select a suitable timetable for the courses</li></ul><p>After this I came to university to attend orientation where I got to get the feel of the university, it taught me on how the first semester is going to be like. For my first day, I arrived an hour earlier than the start time of my course to find the lecture hall. I used the maze map from the UON application to find the hall and like any other first day class, the professor gave a briefing on what the course is about and what we need to do. This is how my first semester of undergraduate degree in Information Technology began.</p><p>A couple of weeks of the first semester went in a blur as I was enjoying the experience of studying at an international university without realizing assessment of the courses were due. Suddenly the study load increased and it was almost hard for me to handle it. I did not realize most of the course assignments required a formation of a group in order to complete them. Then I got myself together and focused on assignments and formed a group to finish assignments on time. Assignments have their requirements and marking criteria and they require references which I did not have much knowledge of. I enquired about assignments with the course coordinator on what to do properly. Finally, I was able to finish my first set of assignments on time with correct procedure. Then came semester recess which is basically a two-week break, this was the time where I caught on the course studies where I was behind. In the break, I revisited the recorded lectures to overcome that. After the break, the courses continued as usual with quizzes and assignments, then the semester ended and exam time. Exams are very important as in most of the courses it is a mandatory thing to get a passing grade inorder to complete the course. Therefore, I revised all my courses’ lectures and study materials in order to prepare for the exam. After completing the exams ended this is how my first semester ended.</p><p>My suggestion for newly admitted students:</p><ul><li>Enroll in courses ahead of time so that you can choose course timetable suitable for you</li><li>AskUON and Student Central are important for students regarding any queries, they are there to help students</li><li>Get up to date with the university email that is Outlook so that you do not miss on the course announcements and update</li><li>In Information Technology degree, most of the assignments are group assignment, therefore try to form a group as soon as possible and do not forget put references where required</li></ul>', 'dipesh', '2021-05-29 02:59:26', '2021-05-29 02:59:26'),
(5, 'My First Semester - Dongyang Xie', '<p><strong>My first day</strong></p><p>On the first day of university, I, like most new students, used the interactive map on the UoN website to walk there. As I stood in advance and got off the bus near the student dormitory, I spent more money. It took nearly half an hour to arrive in the classroom. Fortunately, I started from home early, so I was not late for the first class.</p><p><strong>My first class</strong></p><p>My first class was also a lecture. Due to my early arrival, when I first arrived in the classroom, the last class in the classroom was not over yet, so I waited outside the classroom before entering after the end of the last class. My first course is divided into two parts: lecture and laboratory every week. In the first week, all students listen to the content of the course explained by the teacher. The laboratory starts from the second week. When participating in the laboratory, the four students are divided into groups. In the experiment class, the teacher will assign some classwork for group members to discuss, and then the group will feed back the results of the discussion to the teacher. This is a very interesting way of group interaction.</p><p><strong>Semester time</strong></p><p>After getting acquainted with the campus, I entered daily campus life. Several days a week, I need to take the school bus from downtown Newcastle to the Callaghan campus for classes. The journey will take me nearly 45 minutes. Since the courses in the first semester were relatively easy, I didn\'t encounter too much trouble in the process of learning. However, because English is not my native language, I occasionally encounter some troubles in communication and exchanges with the group, but fortunately, these problems have also been resolved through repeated communication. When encountering difficulties in the course, I usually take the initiative to communicate with teachers or other team members through emails and ask for their help. In most cases, they responded to my emails quickly. With their help, my assignment for the first semester was successfully completed.</p><p><strong>Exams</strong></p><p>For me, exams are very stressful. Due to time constraints, I often look up at the clock on the wall to confirm the time during the exam. In addition, the way to take the test is to put a piece of A4 size note paper into the test room, so I will try my best to write the key points in it before the test. This has led to most of my exam time looking for answers to questions on A4 paper. Fortunately, my preparation was quite adequate, and I passed the exams in the first semester smoothly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>', 'dongyang', '2021-05-30 11:28:16', '2021-05-30 11:28:16');

We advise that you study these first, this will strengthen these weak points and you will not struggle with these in the exam. These always may take the most time, so you should start off with these!</p><p>Different exams have different permissions, so for most engineering exams you will allowed a ‘reference sheet’ or otherwise known as a ‘cheat sheet’ which you can put any information on that sheet that you can reference from within the exam. This sheet is one A4 piece of paper which can be written on both sides.</p><p>Also, exams are open book, but you should not bring every book that you have relating to the course, as this can make you run out of time in the exam.</p><p><strong>How an exam plans out</strong></p><p>We shall talk about when you go in for an exam, as this is the catalyst for most students. (I promise you this is okay! Every is going to be anxious, stressed and all kinds of things. Everyone is feeling the pressure as much as you!)</p><p>Once you reach a theatre or anything similar, you will be seated, you may need to find your seat number before hand, (unless its an online exam) and you will be read out instructions on what you can have out (aka calculator, pencil, pens). During this time you will have to be completely silent, as these are exam rules.</p><p>Once you get your paper, the exam supervisors will write a reading commencement time, and during this time you can look through your exam paper and go through what you are being assessed against.&nbsp;</p><p>Use this time wisely! You should flip through all the pages first, reading through each question. Then you can decide what questions you can answer right away and figure out what would be the most time efficient! (for example, if you feel more comfortable doing the longer parts of the exam first, you should, and then come back to the shorter stuff later. In these exams you should always aim for the most marks!)</p><p>Time management within an exam is very important, and this is why we say if you feel more comfortable doing something else first, rather doing the paper in order, is because the stuff you feel more accustomed to doing, means you will most likely do it faster then something you don’t have in your head as of that moment.</p><p>Then once the reading time is done the exam supervisors will allow you to start the exam, so making a little plan during the reading time is super good to do. But you do not need to do this every time.</p><p><strong>Different type of exams</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Multiple exams can span into different area of ways being done, such as:</p><ul><li>Online exams</li><li>Mid-term exams</li><li>In-class exams</li><li>Practical exam</li><li>Final exam</li></ul><p><strong>Online Exams</strong></p><p>The exams that are online, are done through blackboard. These exams are the close to the same as an in-class exam, but these are done in the comfort of home on your computer, these exams can be at a set time, or over a span of time which must be done between those times. For example</p><p>A set time would be “Exam starts are 3:00pm and ends at 5:00pm” This means if you do not get on and do the exam in those times you cannot participate and will get a 0. (Personally would get on nearly 10 minutes early to check for emails and be ready for the entire time.</p><p>A spanned time would be “Exam can be started at 10:00am, and will end at 7:00pm. Only 2 hours of time permitted”. This means that the exam can be started between 10am-7pm but only 2 hours of time will be given once you press start on the exam, so be ready for it before pressing start! Also if you start it less to 2 hours before 7pm (i.e 6:30pm). You will only be given the time before the exam finished. (So if you start at 6:30pm you would only have 30 minutes to complete an exam that is supposed to take 2 hours).</p><p><strong>Mid-term Exams</strong></p><p>Mid-term exams are an exam that is usually done within your lecture time, which will cover the information that you have covered from the weeks before.

This can be accessed via blackboard on Mac or Windows. If you are not able to use one of those, the campus will have computers that you can use to attend.</p><p><strong>Face to face Lectures</strong></p><p>These lectures are the mainly used ones, the online alternatives are used if the university can not be attended. These will involve you going to the lecture room on campus, and will be watching the slides that you have looked over, and discussing/learn the topic for the week.</p><p>Link ref: <a href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/S8pG2oAC1AsL7ztK7\">https://images.app.goo.gl/S8pG2oAC1AsL7ztK7</a></p><p>Lectures will normally have a lecturer out the front that talk about the slides that will be on a big screen displaying to all students, they will talk about the slides, and that will be the topic/topics you will be learning for the week. These are very beneficial to go to because these will help you in assessments and exams.</p><p>Lectures go for around 1-2 Hours long, sometimes with a 5 minutes break in between the hours on a 2 hour lecture.</p><p>Lectures start 5 minutes are the hour and finish 5 minutes before the hour. So what this means is that if there was a lecture on at 1pm and it went to 3pm, it would technically start at 1:05pm and finish at 2:55pm. But this does not mean you should leave it to the last minute, this buffer is only to allow students time for walking across campus.</p><p>Getting you lectures 5 minutes early should be the aim.</p><p><strong>Workshops</strong></p><p>These are much similar to high school classes, you will be going over that was learnt from the lecture, and be applying it to some similar work to help understand the topic. This is a much more lax area, where you will be able to communicate with other students and a teacher which may be the lecturer.&nbsp;</p><p>A couple tips would be:</p><p>Don’t be shy, ask questions</p><p>If you don’t understand something, you should ask a questions, even if it sound silly it will help yourself in the long run.</p><p>Try to finish the work</p><p>Though it isn’t required, finishing the work means that you most likely understand the content for the week.</p><p>These workshops sometimes happen in computer labs (especially for students doing a course in computing) and most students in there will be in the same situation as you, all learning the same thing so don’t be scared!</p><p>These also can be online, nearly identical to online lectures.</p><p>The teachers are very friendly and are always there to help you with all problems about the work for the week, and will help you understand it if you are stuck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>', 'lectures-workshops', 'blog', '2021-05-29 17:49:17', '2021-05-29 17:49:17'),

You will attend lectures that you will find on your blackboard <a href=\"https://uonline.newcastle.edu.au/\">website</a>. Which you will get taught about content in the lecture, and then delve into it in a simpler basis and maybe more hands-on approach to help understand the content.</p><p>Activities range from multiple things such as, joining a club, sporting and/or charity days, these are advertised around the university for you to do.</p><p>By going through this website will guide you through university and everything you need to know.

But in some areas around university, it doesn’t have, so you will have pin point that room yourself, but it should show you the way to a building. For example, here:</p><p>Say you needed to go to the ES building, not for exactly ES-204, but for ES-241 for example, it would get you most of the way there. Then once you are inside the building there are multiple ways on finding the correct room.</p><p>There are maps on each floor on the walls as entering each floor, this will help you around the floor and where your actual room is. Or you could ask someone.</p><p>If you are unable to get the app, there are other ways to figure out where to go.

As you can see most information can be accessed from this, but mainly for what we are talking about, the getting around tab is what we will look at.</p><p>(This is also accessible from your myUON webpage on computers)</p><p>Campus maps, shuttles (if needing to go into the city for classes) and other very useful information is displayed within this app and can be used to get around university.</p><p>This page is mainly focused towards the Callaghan campus, but the application works with other campus’ so it can be used in those locations also.</p><p>Shuttles are used to get around university safely and quickly.
